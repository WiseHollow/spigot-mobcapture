MobCapture was written to give people a free alternative to MobCatcher(the full version). With MobCapture you are able to throw a projectile of your choice when capturing a mob. This feature also extends to Arrows if you so choose.

After your projectile hits your target, if you have the proper permissions the mob will turn into a special spawn egg. This spawn egg saves all forms of data concerning this mob (All that I could think to add).

Payment for capturing a mob can be either in the form of items or money. See the config on how to change between the two.
